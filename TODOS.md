> As noted previously, the data collection practices changed between 2014 and 2015 due to the suspense of the federal arrest-related death reporting. And as noted, the DOJ only maintains the data that has been reported to us by our reporting agencies. Accordingly, the 2015 data set you were provided contains what was reported to us. The DOJ cannot comment on what might be missing as the responsibility to report falls upon the agencies; we are the repository.
